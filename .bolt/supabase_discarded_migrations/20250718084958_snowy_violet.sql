-- Update auth settings to disable email confirmation for development
-- Note: This would typically be done in Supabase dashboard settings
-- For now, we'll handle it in the application logic

-- Ensure users table allows creation without email confirmation
ALTER TABLE users

-- Update RLS policies to allow unconfirmed users to create profiles
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow unconfirmed users to create profile" ON users;
CREATE POLICY "Allow unconfirmed users to create profile"
  ON users
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
